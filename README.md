Firefox addon that blocks specific domains that the user has saved under settings. The blocked page will instead show a checklist, which when completed, unblocks all pages until 8:00 AM (or whatever time you set) the next day. At 9:00 PM (or specified time) a tasks page will open asking for tasks for the next day. Those tasks are then used for the checklist the following day.

This project's handling of blocking and URL storage was based on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/WesleyBranton/Website-Blocker).
